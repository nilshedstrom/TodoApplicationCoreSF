# TodoApplicationCoreSF
This project contains a simple Todo Application that is using Service Fabric and is written in .NET Core

The goal was to make a demo project showing how easy it is to get started with an stateless web service calling an actor (TodoActor)

The responsibility of the TodoActor is to handle the actual list for one user (identified by email address).
